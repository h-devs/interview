# Interview Questions

## Behavioral Questions

### Junior Level
1. Why did you want to work in software development?
> Reveals the candidate’s character and their passion for the industry.
2. What skills do you think are important for a Junior Software Developer?
> Demonstrates the candidates' understanding of the role and their function.
3. What programming languages are you most familiar with?
> Highlights the candidate’s skillset and reveals areas that would require improvement.
4. How would you troubleshoot software bugs?
> Reveals knowledge of coding practices and problem-solving skills.
5. What part of software development do you think is the most difficult?
> Highlights areas of expertise and possible gaps in knowledge.
6. What’s your experience with coding so far?
7. Do you have any experience with Agile methodologies?
8. Are you interested in further developing your skills?
9. What are your favorite types of projects to work on?
10. Tell me about the software engineering project you’re most proud of. What did you do that worked out particularly well? 
11. Tell me about the software development project you’re least proud of. What would you do differently?
12. What do you know about our company?
13. Tell me about AJAX (JavaScript) in detail. Can you give me an example of when you last used it?
> When interviewers ask you such software engineer “explanatory” questions, the point really is not to explain the definition but to tell how you are going to use it in your code. This signals the interviewer that you can actually “think.” And it also displays the way you approach coding.
14. How would you explain APIs to non-technical stakeholders? 
> It’s the messenger between software products. It allows software systems to communicate with each other and synchronize. For example, you can use, say, Facebook’s API to display your Facebook posts on your website. And allow people to share or comment on your posts directly from your website without switching over to Facebook.
15. Can you describe the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture?
> It separates data from the user interface. The MVC architecture is mostly used for GUI applications. The model layer contains the data, the view layer sends the data to the user, and the controller is the one that makes changes to the model based on user input.
16. What is a recursive function?
> A function that calls itself directly or indirectly. The recursion continues until it reaches a set of parameters that return a value instead of calling the function recursively. A recursive function can solve specific problems quite quickly.
17. Please explain big-O notation in the simplest terms.
> The big-O notation tells how fast an algorithm is. This is very important whether you are evaluating other people’s algorithms or your own.
> Big-O notation, also known as Landau’s symbol, tells how the runtime or space requirement of a function grows as the input grows. Which means that the algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds but in the growth of the number of operations.
18. What web technologies are you excited about, and why do you think they’ll win/survive in the next decade?
